                In general, the Products are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, or 16 where applicable, and the terms for certain Products may specify further age-related restrictions. In cases where certain Products are intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable), we will post appropriate notices and take steps as required by applicable law to safeguard children’s data. In addition, we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable) through form submissions on our Products, although certain third party sites that we link to may do so.
